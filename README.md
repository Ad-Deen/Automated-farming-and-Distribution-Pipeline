# Automated Farming and Distribution Pipeline

## Overview

This project explores an automated farming and distribution pipeline within a simulated greenhouse environment. It leverages technologies to optimize crop growth, harvesting, and delivery, aiming for greater efficiency, productivity, and sustainability.

## Key Features

### Automated Farming

Precision Planting: Seeds are sown with optimal spacing and depth, ensuring uniform germination and growth.
Sensor-Driven Monitoring: Sensors continuously track environmental conditions (light, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and nutrient levels).
Automated Irrigation and Fertilization: Water and nutrients are delivered precisely based on plant needs, minimizing waste.
Pest and Disease Detection: Early identification of threats triggers targeted interventions, reducing crop losses.
Robotic Harvesting: Ripe crops are harvested efficiently and carefully to maintain quality.
### Distribution Pipeline

Automated Sorting and Grading: Harvested produce is sorted and graded based on quality standards.
Packaging and Labeling: Products are prepared for transport, ensuring freshness and traceability.
Inventory Management: Stock levels are monitored and optimized to meet demand.
Optimized Routing and Delivery: Logistics are streamlined to ensure timely delivery to consumers or retailers, potentially using autonomous vehicles or drones.
## Simulation Environment

Blender 3D Environment: The greenhouse and its components are realistically modeled in Blender, enabling visual representation of the pipeline's operations.
Physics-Based Simulations: Interactions between plants, machinery, and the environment are simulated to assess performance and identify potential improvements.
