# Automated Farming and Distribution Pipeline

## Overview

This project explores an automated farming and distribution pipeline within a simulated greenhouse environment. It leverages technologies to optimize crop growth, harvesting, and delivery, aiming for greater efficiency, productivity, and sustainability.

## Key Features

### Automated Farming

Precision Planting: Seeds are sown with optimal spacing and depth, ensuring uniform germination and growth.
Sensor-Driven Monitoring: Sensors continuously track environmental conditions (light, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and nutrient levels).
Automated Irrigation and Fertilization: Water and nutrients are delivered precisely based on plant needs, minimizing waste.
Pest and Disease Detection: Early identification of threats triggers targeted interventions, reducing crop losses.
Robotic Harvesting: Ripe crops are harvested efficiently and carefully to maintain quality.
### Distribution Pipeline

Automated Sorting and Grading: Harvested produce is sorted and graded based on quality standards.
Packaging and Labeling: Products are prepared for transport, ensuring freshness and traceability.
Inventory Management: Stock levels are monitored and optimized to meet demand.
Optimized Routing and Delivery: Logistics are streamlined to ensure timely delivery to consumers or retailers, potentially using autonomous vehicles or drones.
## Simulation Environment

Blender 3D Environment: The greenhouse and its components are realistically modeled in Blender, enabling visual representation of the pipeline's operations.
Physics-Based Simulations: Interactions between plants, machinery, and the environment are simulated to assess performance and identify potential improvements.

## Project Structure

Welcome to our Automated Farming and Distribution Pipeline project! Our endeavor involves a systematic approach, seamlessly integrating mechanical design, simulation, and real-world implementation. Let's explore the key steps in our project structure:

### 1. Mechanical Design

Our journey begins with meticulous mechanical design, where we craft the environment for optimal efficiency and functionality. Leveraging tools like Fusion 360, we bring our concepts to life through detailed CAD models. These models serve as the foundation for the entire project, providing a blueprint for both virtual and physical components.

### 2. CAD to URDF Conversion

To bridge the virtual and real-world aspects, we convert our CAD files into URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) compatible with Gazebo simulation. This step ensures that our virtual environment mirrors the physical setup accurately, laying the groundwork for realistic simulations.

### 3. Sensor Integration

The intelligence of our system relies on accurate sensor data. We install and configure sensor drivers to capture essential information from the environment. This step is pivotal for enabling our automated system to make informed decisions based on real-time feedback.

### 4. Actuator Implementation

With sensors in place, we empower our system to take action. Actuators are integrated into the pipeline, allowing the execution of tasks based on the sensor feed. This brings the project to life, enabling autonomous responses and interactions within the environment.

### Project Workflow Overview
